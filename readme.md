**Description:**
Flycut is a clean and simple clipboard manager for developers. It's based on an open source app called Jumpcut.

Every time you copy a code piece, Flycut stores it in history. Later, you can paste it using Shift-Command-V even if you have something different in your current clipboard. You can change the hotkey and other settings in preferences.

Developed by developers for developers.
