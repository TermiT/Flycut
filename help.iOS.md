**Basics**

Copy the same way as always.

Paste the same way as always.

Open Flycut to save the current clipping if it hasn't already been saved.  Tap any clipping in Flycut to place it on the clipboard.  Swipe right on any clipping to delete it, or swipe left to open it if it is a web link.

**Details**

A clipping will move to the top of the list when tapped to place it on the clipboard.

Only the most recent 40 clippings will be retained.

Formatting is stripped from clippings, allowing you to paste without carrying along unwanted formatting.
